# GithubUserApp

In order to finished my online course "Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Android" from Dicoding, i was tasked to build Github User App for Android platform. The app will allows you to search all of registered Github users, seeing the detail info of the user, including who follow and who are followed, and add/remove them from your Favorite list. The app implemented some fundamentals things, such as usage of Github API and JSON Parsing, Option Menu, Search Bar, SQLite Database for Favorite list, and Content Provider to access shared data by other app.
